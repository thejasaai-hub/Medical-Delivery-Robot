# **Medical Delivery Robot**

## **Overview**
- The Medical Delivery Robot is a ROS-based autonomous robot designed to deliver medicines 
to patient rooms in a hospital setting. By leveraging advanced technologies such as computer vision, 
SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), and autonomous navigation, this project aimed to enhance 
safety and efficiency in healthcare workflows while reducing the need for human intervention in routine tasks.

## **Features**
- Autonomous navigation using Robot Operating System (ROS).
- **Hector Mapping (SLAM)** for real-time localization and mapping.
- Teleoperation for initial control using *teleop_twist_keyboard*.
- Computer vision integration for precise room identification and delivery.
- Designed to navigate and operate in dynamic and unpredictable hospital environments.

## **Key Achievements**
- üèÜ Second Place at the project competition hosted by Amrita College of Engineering, Coimbatore, India.
- The project later secured funding from the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change, Harvard Medical School,
  recognizing its potential in healthcare innovation.
- Successfully demonstrated a ROS-based robot capable of autonomous medicine delivery.
- Represented the project in a competitive setting, gaining recognition for innovation and technical expertise.
  
*Note:* While I was not directly involved in securing the funding, I take pride in contributing to the 
foundational work that showcased the project's value and impact.
